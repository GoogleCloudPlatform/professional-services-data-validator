### Warning 

The Airflow DAG code expects the raw config JSON only, 
it does not support a JSON format that was generated by converting an existing
YAML config file.

Parameters from YAML format are slightly different from the JSON config,
there is an example for Cloud Run [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator/tree/develop/samples/run#test-cloud-run-endpoint) 
that shows the expected JSON config in the `'data'` variable. 

[This](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator/blob/develop/data_validation/config_manager.py#L444) 
is where the raw JSON config is generated in the DVT code.
