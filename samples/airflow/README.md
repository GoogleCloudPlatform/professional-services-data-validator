### Warning 

The Airflow DAG code expects the raw config JSON only, 
it does not support a JSON format that was generated by converting an existing
YAML config file.

Parameters from YAML format are slightly different from the JSON config,
there is an example for Cloud Run [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator/tree/develop/samples/run#test-cloud-run-endpoint) 
that shows the expected JSON config in the `'data'` variable.

For example, check the following YAML config part.

```yaml
result_handler: {}
source: my_bq_conn
target: my_bq_conn
validations:
- aggregates:
  - field_alias: count
    source_column: null
    target_column: null
    type: count
...
```

This YAML is equivalent to the JSON part below, where the source param is written as `source_conn`.

```json
{
    "source_conn": BQ_CONN,
    "target_conn": BQ_CONN,
    ...
    "aggregates": [
        {
            "field_alias": "count",
            "source_column": None,
            "target_column": None,
            "type": "count",
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

For more implementation details, [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator/blob/develop/data_validation/config_manager.py#L444) 
is where the raw JSON config is generated in the DVT code.
