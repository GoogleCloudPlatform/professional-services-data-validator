# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Local Testing

This project uses [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) for managing tests. Install nox to your local environment and it will handle creating the virtual environments required for each test.

To run our local testing suite, use:

`python3 -m nox --envdir ~/dvt/envs/ -s unit_small blacken lint`

See [our script](tests/local_check.sh) for using nox to run tests step by step.

You can also test with pytest directly:
```python
pip install pyfakefs==4.6.2
pytest tests/unit
```

To lint your code, run:
```
pip install black==22.3.0
pip install flake8
black $BLACK_PATHS # Find this variable in our noxfile
flake8 data_validation
flake8 tests
```
The above is similar to our [nox lint test](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator/blob/179d1c5378e1c727f579cb5083a2565f9a772f45/noxfile.py#L91).
