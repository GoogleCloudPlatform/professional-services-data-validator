""" The Ibis Addons Operations are intended to help facilitate new expressions
when required before they can be pushed upstream to Ibis.

Raw SQL Filters:
The ability to inject RawSQL into a query DNE in Ibis.  It must be built out
and applied to each Ibis Data Source directly as each has
extended it's own registry.  Eventually this can potentially be pushed to
Ibis as an override, though it would not apply for Pandas and other
non-textual languages.
